Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways. Civil engineering profession Engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence. The earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 BC in ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley civilization, and Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq) when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence, creating a need for the construction of shelter. During this time, transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing. HoD Message. NCIT has been offering Bachelorâ€™s program in Civil Engineering since 2013 AD. From the very beginning, we are committed to imparting up-to-date Civil   Engineering knowledge, skills and values among our students and enabling them to compete and contribute in the local and the global arena.
